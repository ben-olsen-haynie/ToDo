<!-- TO DO:
When I copy the first buttonWithText it is making multiple ids.
    need to make those classes. But every time I try and make them classes
    instead of ids, my add entree button doesn't work. I think I
    need to generate the div and button instead of copying it but also
    add a class while it generates it. When I copy the original
    buttonWithText quite a few ids are attached and I have to re-work
    it all to class or just have it generate a class from the start.


    CAN'T FIGURE OUT YET
- When you add an entree, the text box needs to be empty.
- The BUTTON in buttonWithText needs to be functional.

QUESTIONS
- Can I add a class to a div I havn't created yet. 
    EX: js:23-28 targetng 'newContent' aka text box so I can clear the text

EVENTUALLY
- I want the ToDoDiv to be empty untill you click 'Add Entree'
